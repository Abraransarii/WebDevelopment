        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
        posted by BGB, November 15, 2016
        <p>
          This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking
          technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn
          >. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually
          vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to
          the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book,
          <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as
          <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          Next month, we will be serving
          <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a
          seat at the chef table, contact us before
